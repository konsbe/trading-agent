## Technical Analysis Fields

### RSI 14 (Relative Strength Index)

Measures momentum — how fast price is moving.

`< 30` → 🔴 **oversold** — Price has fallen too fast. Potential bounce candidate.
`30–70` → ✅ Normal range. No momentum extreme.
`> 70` → 🔴 **overbought** — Price has risen too fast. Potential pullback candidate.

Example: `RSI 14: 48.8 ✅` → neutral momentum.

### MACD (12/26/9)

Measures trend momentum shifts.

`hist -1.110` — Histogram value. Negative = bearish momentum, positive = bullish.
`🟢 bullish cross` — MACD line crossed above signal line → momentum turning up
`🔴 bearish cross` — MACD line crossed below signal line → momentum turning down

Cross labels only appear if currently firing. Otherwise just the histogram value.

### ADX 14 (Average Directional Index)

Measures how **strong** the current trend is (not the direction).

`< 20` — Weak or no trend. Market is ranging, signals are less reliable.
`20–25` — Trend developing.
`> 25` — Strong trend. Directional signals are more reliable.
`> 40` — Very strong trend.

Example: `ADX 14: 32.7` → moderately strong trend.

### Trend

Calculated from the slope of the EMA (Exponential Moving Average).

`📈 uptrend (slope +0.44%)` — EMA sloping upward, price consistently rising
`📉 downtrend (slope -0.44%)` — EMA sloping down, price consistently falling
`↔️ sideways (slope -0.05%)` — EMA flat, no clear direction
`— down` — Slope too shallow to classify confidently

The slope % is the EMA's rate of change per bar relative to current price.

### MA Cross (Moving Average Cross)

Compares the 50-period and 200-period Simple Moving Averages.

`🟢 Golden cross` — 50 SMA crossed **above** 200 SMA → long-term bullish signal
`🔴 Death cross` — 50 SMA crossed **below** 200 SMA → long-term bearish signal
`—` — No cross recently, MAs aligned without a recent crossover

### ATR 14 (Average True Range)

The average daily price swing in dollars over the last 14 bars.

Example: `ATR 14: 5.58` → AAPL typically moves ±$5.58 per day. Useful for stop-losses.

Higher ATR = more volatility. Lower ATR = tighter price action (often precedes a squeeze).

### BB Squeeze (Bollinger Band Squeeze)

`🔴 ACTIVE — breakout expected` — Bollinger Bands are now **inside** Keltner Channels. Volatility has compressed to an unusually tight range. A big move is building. Direction unknown until the breakout occurs.
`—` — No squeeze, bands are at normal width.

One of the highest-value alerts — it often precedes sharp directional moves.

### VIX Regime (Market Fear Index)

The VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) measures expected market volatility. Sourced from FRED (`VIXCLS`). Only shown for equity symbols.

`😱 extreme_fear` (VIX > 35) — Market is in panic. High risk, but also opportunity for contrarian longs.
`⚠️ elevated` (VIX 20–35) — Investors are hedging more than usual. Risk-off environment.
`✅ normal` (VIX 12–20) — Calm market. Typical conditions.
`💤 complacency` (VIX < 12) — Investors are overconfident. Vulnerable to a surprise shock.

Thresholds configurable via `TECHNICAL_VIX_FEAR_THRESHOLD`, `TECHNICAL_VIX_ELEVATED_THRESHOLD`, `TECHNICAL_VIX_COMPLACENCY_THRESHOLD`.

Example: `VIX Regime: ⚠️ elevated (VIX 25.2)`

### Pivots (Classic Pivot Points)

Key price levels derived from the prior day's OHLC. Used as support/resistance reference.

`PP` (Pivot Point) — Central level. Price often oscillates around it.
`R1` (Resistance 1) — First resistance above PP. Common intraday ceiling.
`S1` (Support 1) — First support below PP. Common intraday floor.

Example: `PP $252.12 | R1 $257.15 | S1 $248.77`
If price is at $254.81 — it's between PP and R1, closer to resistance.

### SMC — Smart Money Concepts

`FVGs: 2 active` (Fair Value Gaps) — Price moved so fast it left a gap. These gaps act like magnets — price tends to revisit them. "Active" = not yet filled.
`OBs: 7 active` (Order Blocks) — Last opposing candle before a strong impulse move. Marks where institutions entered. Price often returns to test these zones.
`Liq sweeps: 5` (Liquidity Sweeps) — Price briefly broke a prior high/low and reversed within the same bar. Institutions hunting retail stop-losses. Count = how many occurred in recent bars.

### Chart Patterns

`🔴 H&S ✅ confirmed` — **Head & Shoulders** (bearish reversal). 3 peaks. `✅ confirmed` = price already broke below the neckline → signal active.
`🔴 H&S (unconfirmed)` — Pattern forming but neckline not yet broken. Watch, don't act.
`🟢 Inv. H&S ✅ confirmed` — **Inverse H&S** (bullish reversal). 3 troughs. `✅ confirmed` = price broke above neckline → signal active.
`🟢 Inv. H&S (unconfirmed)` — Pattern forming, neckline not yet broken.
`△ ascending` — Higher lows + flat resistance. Typically bullish breakout setup.
`△ descending` — Lower highs + flat support. Typically bearish.
`△ symmetrical` — Highs and lows converging. Direction unclear until breakout.
`🟢 Bull flag` — Strong up-move followed by tight consolidation. Breakout typically upward.
`🔴 Bear flag` — Strong down-move followed by a tight bounce. Breakout typically downward.

The **Balance Sheet health score** in the embed title combines ROE, D/E, and Current Ratio into a single [-1 … +1] score.

`🟢 healthy` — Multiple strong balance-sheet signals
`🟡 neutral` — Mixed signals
`🔴 stressed` — Multiple red flags in leverage or liquidity

---

### ROE (Return on Equity)

How efficiently the company generates profit from shareholders' equity. Sustained ROE > 15% for 5+ years is the Buffett-style moat signal.

`🟢 excellent` > 15% — Strong moat. Company creates significant value per dollar of equity.
`🟡 adequate` 8–15% — Acceptable but not exceptional capital efficiency.
`🔴 destroying_value` < 8% — Capital allocation is eroding shareholder value.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_ROE_EXCELLENT` (default 15) and `FUNDAMENTAL_ROE_ADEQUATE` (default 8).

The `ROA` (Return on Assets) shown inline is informational: > 10% high efficiency, 5–10% moderate, < 5% low.

### Debt/Equity (D/E Ratio)

How much debt finances the business versus equity. Rising interest rates make high-debt companies more vulnerable — each refinancing hits earnings harder.

`🟢 conservative` D/E < 1.0 — Low leverage. Strong financial position.
`🟡 manageable` D/E 1–2× — Acceptable. Monitor debt maturity schedule.
`🔴 high_leverage` D/E > 2× — Demands scrutiny. Industry context essential — utilities safely operate at 3–4×.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_DE_CONSERVATIVE` (default 1.0) and `FUNDAMENTAL_DE_MANAGEABLE` (default 2.0).

### Net Debt / EBITDA

Cleaner leverage metric than D/E — accounts for cash holdings. Proxy computed as: (Total Debt − Cash) ÷ (Operating Income × 4).

`🟢 net_cash` — Company holds more cash than total debt. Ultra-safe.
`🟢 conservative` < 2× — Low leverage relative to earnings power.
`🟡 manageable` 2–4× — Monitor, especially if interest rates are rising.

### EV/EBITDA

Capital-structure neutral valuation — removes the effect of different debt levels, tax rates, and depreciation choices. **Always compare within sector.** Tech typically 20–30×, industrials 10–15×, utilities 8–12×.

`🟢 value_territory` < 10× — Potentially undervalued relative to earnings.
`🟡 fairly_valued` 10–20× — Standard valuation range for most industries.
`🔴 growth_premium_required` > 20× — Requires strong, sustained earnings growth to justify.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_EV_EBITDA_VALUE` (default 10) and `FUNDAMENTAL_EV_EBITDA_FAIR` (default 20).

### Current Ratio

`🟢 safe` > 1.5 — Comfortable liquidity buffer.
`🟡 monitor` 1.0–1.5 — Adequate but watch closely if debt maturities are approaching.
`🔴 liquidity_risk` < 1.0 — Short-term liabilities exceed liquid assets. Not always fatal but demands explanation.

The `Quick` ratio shown inline is stricter — it excludes inventory. > 1.0 adequate, 0.7–1.0 monitor, < 0.7 risk.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_CURRENT_RATIO_SAFE` (default 1.5) and `FUNDAMENTAL_CURRENT_RATIO_MONITOR` (default 1.0).

### Price/Book (P/B)

Market price vs. net asset value. Most relevant for banks, insurers, and asset-heavy industries. **Tech companies with heavy intangibles make P/B less meaningful — use EV/EBITDA instead.**

`🟢 value_signal` P/B < 1.5 — Market values company near (or below) its book assets.
`⚪ fair` P/B 1.5–5× — Standard range for most industries.
`🔴 limited_safety_margin` P/B > 5× — Little asset-backed downside protection.

### Dividend Yield

Annual dividend as % of share price. Shown only if the company pays a dividend.

`🟢 sustainable_income` Yield 2–6%, Payout < 60% — Generous income with room for maintenance.
`🟡 moderate_yield` 2–6%, payout not assessed — Moderate income.
`🟡 verify_payout` Yield > 6% — High yield; verify payout ratio before investing.
`🔴 cut_risk` Payout > 80% — Dividend may be cut if earnings dip slightly.
`⚪ no_dividend` < 2% or no dividend — Growth company or dividend suspended.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_DIVIDEND_YIELD_MIN/HIGH` and `FUNDAMENTAL_PAYOUT_RATIO_SAFE/DANGER`.

### CapEx Intensity

Capital expenditure as % of revenue. Asset-light businesses (SaaS, brands) keep CapEx < 5% and convert most of their earnings into free cash. Capital-intensive industries (semiconductors, airlines, mining) must constantly reinvest.

`🟢 asset_light` < 5% of revenue — High FCF conversion potential.
`🟡 moderate_intensity` 5–20% — Typical for manufacturing, consumer.
`🔴 capital_intensive` > 20% — Heavy reinvestment required; FCF constrained.

Configurable via `FUNDAMENTAL_CAPEX_INTENSITY_LOW` (default 5) and `FUNDAMENTAL_CAPEX_INTENSITY_HIGH` (default 20).
